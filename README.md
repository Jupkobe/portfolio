# portfolio_the_app
Portfolio is an app to track your crypto portfolio. 

![Concept](https://github.com/Jupkobe/portfolio_the_app/assets/84783072/fd58ec04-0c2d-463d-b674-8e0cc6e88ba3)

Objective is getting data with API and serving it to track coins status on the app. The app functions properly but does not update coins, because couldn't afford an API service.
